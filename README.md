### 3. Recursion
- Call stack overview
- Base cases & return values
- Common pitfalls

- Insert, remove
- Reverse

#### Doubly Linked Lists
- Bidirectional nodes
- More efficient insert/remove operations

#### Stacks & Queues
- LIFO / FIFO concepts
- Implementations using arrays or linked lists

#### Trees
- Tree terminology (root, leaf, height, depth)
- Binary Search Trees (BST)
- Insert, find
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Depth-First Search (DFS): Pre-order, In-order, Post-order

#### Binary Heaps
- Max binary heap
- Priority queue implementation

#### Hash Tables
- Hash functions
- Collision
- Set & get operations

### 7. Graphs
- Adjacency list vs adjacency matrix
- Directed vs undirected graphs
- Weighted vs unweighted graphs

#### Graph Traversal
- Depth-First Search (DFS) – recursive & iterative
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)

#### Graph Algorithms
- Dijkstra’s algorithm (shortest path)
- Priority queue usage

### 8. Dynamic Programming
- Overlapping subproblems
- Optimal substructure
- Memoization (top-down DP)
- Tabulation (bottom-up DP)
- Fibonacci (recursive, memoized, tabulated)
- Coin change (greedy vs DP)

## 🎯 Goal
To strengthen my understanding of algorithms, data structures, and time complexity through practical coding examples.
